# Deployment

## 1. Core

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, replace every placeholder with an independently
generated secret, then validate and start:

```bash
sudo docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yml config
sudo docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yml up -d --build
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health/live
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health/ready
```

The Compose project creates `superlily_bus` and publishes Core only on host
loopback.

## 2. Lily bridge

The existing Lily process runs in the `nb` tmux session managed by the enabled
user unit `tmux-nb.service`. Capture the current tmux log and one known-good
command response before changing it.

Do not treat `Ctrl-C` inside tmux as a permanent stop: ending the inner process
causes the session to exit and the systemd unit automatically creates a new
`nb` session. When the bridge is ready, follow
`bridges/lily_nonebot/README.md`, perform one controlled restart through the
existing supervisor, and watch both the unit and the new tmux pane until Lily
is healthy again. Core failure must not change command behavior.

## 3. Nekro bridge

Pin `kromiose/nekro-agent` to the currently validated digest before adding the
bridge:

```

Copy the plugin as described in `bridges/nekro/README.md`, join
`superlily_bus` with the provided Compose override, and restart Nekro once.

## 4. Rollback

- Lily: remove `plugins.lily_core_bridge` from the explicit plugin list and
  restart Lily.
- Nekro: disable/remove `Superlily.core_bridge`, remove the bus override, and
  restart Nekro.
- Core: stop its Compose project. Neither bot depends on it for responses.
